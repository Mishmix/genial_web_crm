    "pageTitleAccent": "Questions",
    "pageSubtitle": "Everything you need to know before ordering",
    "q1": "What is A/B testing on YouTube?",
    "a1": "YouTube allows uploading multiple thumbnail variants for one video. The platform automatically shows different variants to viewers and collects CTR data. After a few days, the algorithm picks the winner — the thumbnail with the best conversion. This lets you make decisions based on data, not guesses.",
    "q2": "How long does one thumbnail take?",
    "a2": "Standard delivery is 24-48 hours. Rush orders are discussed individually and completed in 4-12 hours. With ongoing collaboration, timelines can be even shorter.",
    "q3": "How much does a thumbnail cost?",
    "a3": "Price depends on complexity and volume. Basic thumbnail starts at $29. A/B variant package starts at $39. Regular clients get special rates. Message on Telegram for a quote for your project.",
    "q4": "Why 100% prepayment?",
    "a4": "This is standard practice for creative services. Prepayment ensures commitment and allows immediate start. If you're not satisfied — I'll revise until you are or refund your money.",
    "q5": "What if I don't like the thumbnail?",
    "a5": "Revision rounds are included. I work until you're fully satisfied. If for any reason you're unhappy after all revisions — full refund.",
    "q6": "Do you work with English-speaking channels?",
    "a6": "Yes, over 60% of clients are English-speaking channels. I work with all languages and understand different market specifics.",
    "q7": "What materials do you need from me?",
    "a7": "Minimum — video topic and desired style. Ideally — references you like, photos for the thumbnail (if needed), and info about your target audience.",
